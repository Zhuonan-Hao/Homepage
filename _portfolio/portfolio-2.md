title: "Perturbation Resilient Central Pattern Generator (PR-CPG) on a Hybrid Bipedal-Wheeled Robot"
excerpt: "Developed PR-CPG algorithm on bipedal robot, which yielded an adaptive and phase-regulated walking gait regardless of external disturbances. <br/>  <img src='https://zhuonan-hao.github.io/Homepage/images/Minitaur.jpeg'>"

The aim of our project was to create the algorithm that can resist and correct the perturbation in the trajectory while performing the CPG between two legs. For that we took 
inspiration from limit cycle theory. At each point,we measure phase ψ of the leg and measure error of that point with each point in the trajectory.
